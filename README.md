Power app is divided into two views. Managerial view, and an employee view. Manager can view the high level of the project and create new tasks to be completed. 
Employees can view their active tasks and complete them in separate view.

Projects follow a heirarchy of Project > Project Main Tasks > Sub Tasks > Assignments.
Because of how bulky the design processes is, there are multiple tiers to the design.
